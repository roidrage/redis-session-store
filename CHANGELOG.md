### Added

- Method alias for `#delete_session` -&gt; `#destroy_session`

### Changed
- Tested version of Ruby 2 up to 2.3.1
- Session config examples to use `redis: { url: '...' }`

### Removed
- Ruby 1.9.3 support due to Rack 2 requirements

## [0.8.1] - 2016-01-25
### Added
- Support for Rails 5 and Rack 2

### Changed
- Error support for redis-rb v3 gem

## [0.8.0] - 2014-08-28
### Added
- Allow for injection of custom redis client
- Explicitly declare actionpack dependency

### Changed
- Spec updates for rspec 3

## [0.7.0] - 2014-04-22
### Fixed
- Issue #38, we now delay writing to redis until a session exists. This is a
  backwards-incompatible change, as it removes the `on_sid_collision` option.
  There is now no checking for sid collisions, however that is very unlikely.

## [0.6.6] - 2014-04-08
### Fixed
- Issue #37, use correct constant for `ENV_SESSION_OPTIONS_KEY` if not passed.

## [0.6.5] - 2014-04-04
### Fixed
- Issue #36, use setnx to get a new session id instead of get. This prevents a
  very rare id collision.

## [0.6.4] - 2014-04-04
### Removed
- `#setnx` usage in v0.6.3 so we can change our sessions

## [0.6.3] - 2014-04-01
### Changed
- Setting session ID with a multi-call `#setnx` and `#expire` instead of
  `#setex`.

### Removed
- `#setnx` change in v0.6.2 as it behaved badly under load, hitting yet another
  race condition issue and pegging the CPU.

## [0.6.2] - 2014-03-31
### Changed
- Use `#setnx` instead of `#get` when checking for session ID collisions, which
  is slightly more paranoid and should help avoid a particularly nasty edge
  case.

## [0.6.1] - 2014-03-17
### Fixed
- Compatibility with `ActionDispatch::Request::Session::Options` when destroying
  sessions.

## [0.6.0] - 2014-03-17
### Added
- Custom serializer configuration
- Custom handling capability for session load errors

### Changed
- Always destroying sessions that cannot be loaded

## [0.5.0] - 2014-03-16
### Added
- Support for `on_sid_collision` handler option
- Support for `on_redis_down` handler option

### Changed
- Keep generating session IDs until one is found that doesn't collide
  with existing session IDs

### Removed
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Drop support for `:raise_errors` option

## [0.4.2] - 2014-03-14
### Changed
- Renaming `load_session` method to not conflict with AbstractStore

## [0.4.1] - (2014-03-13) [YANKED]
### Changed
- Regenerate session ID when session is missing

## [0.4.0] - 2014-02-19

## [0.2.0] - 2013-09-13
### Added
